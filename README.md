## Problem
We are solving: (write later)Current navigation apps focus only on shortest distance or fastest time.

They ignore real-world safety factors like poor lighting, unsafe zones, or local hazards.

No system to include dynamic safety data in route calculation.

Users cannot report real-time local dangers.

Travelers may unknowingly pass through risky areas, especially at night.
## Solution
Develop a crowdsourced safety platform for reporting hazards via map pins.

Allow users to report issues like dark streets, unsafe areas, or stray animals.

Assign safety scores to locations based on reports and frequency.

Create a routing algorithm that prioritizes safer paths over shortest routes.

Provide a “Safety-First” navigation option for secure travel.
