# SafeRoute - AI-Powered Community Safety Navigation

## 🚀 Problem We Are Solving

Urban navigation often leads pedestrians through unsafe areas, especially during night time or in unfamiliar neighborhoods. Current navigation apps focus on speed and distance but ignore critical safety factors such as:
- Poorly lit streets
- Reported crime hotspots
- Animal hazards
- Unsafe areas based on community reports
- School zones requiring extra caution
- Late-night safety concerns

This lack of safety consideration puts vulnerable groups (students, night workers, elderly) at risk during their daily commutes.

## 💡 Our Solution

SafeRoute is an AI-powered community-driven navigation platform that:
- **Intelligent Route Planning**: Calculates routes based on safety scores, not just distance
- **Real-time Hazard Reporting**: Community members can report hazards (dark streets, unsafe areas, animal sightings)
- **Color-coded Routes**: 
  - 🟢 **Green** = Safest path
  - 🔵 **Blue** = Balanced route  
  - 🔴 **Red** = Fast but riskier
- **Scenario-based Safety**: Special modes for night travel, school zones, and late-night commutes
- **Live Safety Tips**: Context-aware safety precautions based on time and location
- **Community Verification**: Hazards are verified by multiple users for accuracy
